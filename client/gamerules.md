## Trick Definition
A "trick" consists of one card played by each player in the game. The first player leads with any card, and other players must follow suit if possible. Once all players have played a card, the trick is complete. The player who played the highest card of the led suit wins the trick and leads the next one.

## Point System
Points are awarded for specific cards:
- Five (5) is worth 5 points
- Ten (10) is worth 10 points
- Ace (A) is worth 15 points
- Queen of Spades (Qâ™ ) is worth 30 points

The player who wins a trick collects all the cards played in that trick and adds any points from those cards to their score.

The goal is to reach a target score (minimum 75 points). The first player to reach or exceed the target score wins the game.
